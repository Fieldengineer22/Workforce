<p>New York, NY – September 25, 2017 – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fieldengineer.com/">Field Engineer</a> (www.FieldEngineer.com), a freelance marketplace designed to connect telecom engineers and telecom businesses based on a powerful platform that streamlines slow and costly talent/job search, interviewing, vetting, hiring and paying processes, has launched amidst a flurry of anticipation. Billed as a “simple process that eliminates barriers of the analog age,” the Fieldengineer.com platform targets businesses and talent who are looking to transcend “old school recruitment hurdles” and is already proving itself to be an indispensable global marketplace.</p>

<p>“The New York-based brains behind Field engineer marketplace live, breathe and bleed telecom,” explains Malik Zakaria, founder and CEO of Fieldengineer.com. “As such, we’re dedicated to directly connecting telecom field engineers and the businesses that hire them to unleash opportunities in an era of ‘insatiable digital demand;’ indeed, regardless of where an individual is in the world, Field Engineer marketplace connects engineers and telecoms every day, proving that nowhere is too far away – and that even remote jobs can be handled easily through our global platform.”</p>

<p>Created by telecom veterans who wished to see engineers go back to work following recessionary layoffs and outsourcing in the industry, the Field Engineer platform enables businesses to engage technicians when, where and how they’re needed in the spirit of “the gig economy.” Furthermore, the platform represents a direct pipeline to fascinating career-building jobs and lucrative opportunities in which users can enrich their resumes, grow their skills and challenge themselves, all while landing gigs that better match their skill-sets. By skipping the processes of hunting for positions, landing interviews and ensuring payments, Fieldengineer.com users can work more independently anywhere – locally and remotely.</p>

<p>On the “Engineers” side of the platform, the telecom Field engineers process begins with signing up and filling out an account profile, wherein prospective users can publish their credentials, skill sets and interests for a worldwide audience, after which they apply and agree on job terms including submitting bids, negotiating terms and receiving job start details. From there, users can begin viewing global project listings while being kept abreast of new ones, before finally completing work and getting paid via Fieldengineer.com portal.</p>

<p>The types of projects found on the Field Engineer platform include those in the areas of CPE Deployment and Test/Turn Up, Network Design and Deployment, PMP Project Manager, VoIP Deployment Services, Site Survey and Site Readiness, MAC and Break-Fix, Wi-Fi Site Surveys and Wi-Fi Deployments, Annual Maintenance Service, Remote Network Engineers and Multi-Site Network Deployment.</p>

<p>“There are a myriad of benefits the Field Engineer marketplace platform brings to the engineer table, beginning with the ability to leverage the gig economy on one’s own schedule in order to excel in his or her career,” states Kaushik Bhaumik, Chief Technology Officer of Fieldengineer.com. “Skills and qualifications are pre-verified by us to speed up the hiring process, and users receive notifications regarding job opportunities and even job awards, all with simple instructions. What’s more, folks can get hired quickly without hunting, promoting, networking or interviewing, and the freedom to obtain local or remote gigs – worldwide – on an online/mobile basis becomes a vivid reality.”</p>

<p>On the “Businesses” side of Fieldengineer.com, users can engage engineers immediately to seize growth opportunities with the powerful platform; Field Engineer marketplace representatives understand that with rising digital consumption, businesses need direct access to flexible technical experts to stay ahead of demand, and through the marketplace, the right specialists can be tapped – both locally and globally. “As telecom veterans, we’re committed to removing the complexities and expensive ‘speed bumps’ that often preclude talent placement so businesses can achieve excellence,” adds Zakaria.</p>

<p>The Fieldengineer.com process for businesses begins with signing up and funding an account, followed by users getting bids, evaluating talent credentials/reviews from bidders, negotiating terms, filling out a work order to post the job listing to get bids and finally engaging real-time tracking to analyze how a project is progressing.</p>
